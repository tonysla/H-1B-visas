# H-1B visa (working permit) in United States

### Exploring dataset from kaggle.com on H-1B visas for froeign workers. 

The codes for the visualizations below are in the .R file of this repository. This is my second time analyzing this type of data. The first time was more than a year ago with the data downloaded from United States Department of Labor. I used tableau then and the results are slightly different since that dataset included more variables and wider range of years. If interested for the difference between the two check [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/elton.islamaj#!/vizhome/WhichforeignsareallowedtoworkinU_S_/Story1)  

### Few things to know before exploring the data.

1. In most cases have at least a college degree.
2. Are skilled workers, have expertise in the field being hired. 
3. Usually the skills they have are on demand.
