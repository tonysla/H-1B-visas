# H-1B visa (working permit) in United States

### Exploring dataset from kaggle.com on H-1B visas for froeign workers. 

The codes for the visualizations below are in the .R file of this repository. This is my second time analyzing this type of data. The first time was more than a year ago with the data downloaded from United States Department of Labor. I used tableau then and the results are slightly different since that dataset included more variables and wider range of years. If interested for the difference between the two check [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/elton.islamaj#!/vizhome/WhichforeignsareallowedtoworkinU_S_/Story1)  

#### Few things to know before exploring the data.

H-1B is issued to foreigns who:

1. In most cases have at least a college degree.
2. Are skilled workers, have expertise in the field being hired. 
3. Usually the skills they have are on demand.
4. Usually have finished their studies in US

What are the criteria for a foreign to acuire the H-1B?

1. A job offer matching person's expertise/education
2. Salary for the job needs to match the job title/position & to be the same with what the other jobs in the area are paying.
3. There are no US citizens with the same skill sets for the job position.
4. The job position needs to be advertised online or on local newspaper etc.
5. A bachelor's degree or higher is required. 

I will explore the dataset only for the foreigns who were certified with H-1B (allowed to work) in United States. Also, I will try to explore the dataset based on the above points. 


#### In which states were the foreigns able to find jobs?

Visualizing top 25 states for the total cases of H-1B visa issued between the years of 2011-2016.

California seems to be the outlier among the other states.   
Let's plot again top 25 states hiring the most but for each year seperatly.
